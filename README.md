# Goods products detection

Goals:
The products were categorized into 3 groups: pharmacy, home and beauty, and the goal of the project is to detect and classify goods in a given image.

Implementiaon:
Developed input-pipeline to feed the input data.
Designed and trained a model using Tensorflow object detection api and SSD-Incpetion pre-weights
Achieved mAP of 0.35.


Following are some of the inference images:
